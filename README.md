# 🗺️ Route Optimization MVP

A collaborative project focused on developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that implements a route optimization algorithm to improve efficiency in travel, delivery, or logistics.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a lightweight, functional MVP that:
- Accepts location-based input (e.g., addresses, coordinates)
- Applies a route optimization algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra, A*, Genetic Algorithm)
- Outputs the most efficient route based on selected criteria (e.g., shortest time, least distance)

This tool could serve use cases in delivery services, travel planning, field technician routing, or logistics.

## 📦 Features (Planned)

- [ ] Clean and modular backend structure
- [ ] Basic frontend interface or API endpoint
- [ ] Input support: manual entry or uploaded data (e.g., CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Route optimization algorithm (TBD)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and testing

## 🧠 Technologies

- Programming Language: `Python` / `JavaScript` / `Node.js` *(decide based on group skillset)*
- Algorithm: Dijkstra / A* / Simulated Annealing / Custom Heuristic
- (Optional)
