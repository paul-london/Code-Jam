# 🗺️ Park Hopper Routes

A collaborative project between TripleTen Data Science and Software Engineering students focused on developing an online tool to plan a vacation to United States National Parks based on their starting location. The interactive experience also includes featured parks and helpful travel tips.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a lightweight, functional tool that:

- Plans a vacation through a selection of National Parks based on the user's preferences
- Applies a route optimization algorithm to minimize travel distance (Greedy Nearest Neighbor)
- Displays the determined travel route on an interactive map

This tool could serve use cases in delivery services, travel planning, field technician routing, or logistics.

## 📦 Features

- Clean and modular backend structure
- Basic frontend interface or API endpoint
- Input support: manual entry or uploaded data (e.g., CSV, JSON)
- Route optimization algorithm (TBD)
- Performance benchmarks and testing

## 🧠 Technologies

- Programming Language: `Python` / `JavaScript` / `REACT`
- Algorithm: Greedy Nearest Neighbor

## 📝 Notes

- Algorithm selection and trade-offs will be discussed as a group.
- Aim to build something that _works_, then iterate and optimize.
- Keep code modular and readable for team collaboration.
