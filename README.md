# 🗺️ Park Hopper Routes

A collaborative project between TripleTen Data Science and Software Engineering students focused on developing an online tool to plan a vacation to United States National Parks based on their starting location. The interactive experience also includes featured parks and helpful travel tips.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a lightweight, functional tool that:

- Plans a vacation through a selection of National Parks based on the user's starting location
- Applies a route optimization algorithm to minimize travel distance (Greedy Nearest Neighbor)
- Displays the determined travel route on an interactive map
- Provide additional park information and travel tips

## 📦 Features

- Clean and modular backend structure
- Basic frontend interface
- Input support: manual entry or uploaded data (e.g., CSV, JSON)
- Route optimization algorithm (Greedy Nearest Neighbors) with performance comparison to random route
- Integrated Google Maps driving data
- Support for six starting states

## 🧠 Technologies

### Software Engineering
- Languages & Frameworks: JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Vite  
- Tools: Git, GitHub Pages, Node.js

### Data Science
- Languages: Python  
- Algorithm: Greedy Nearest Neighbor  
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `folium`, `googlemaps`, `matplotlib`

## 🧭 Next Steps

- Explore more advanced and accurate route algorithms.
- Create regional roadtrips based on starting location and vary their lengths.
- Expand starting point selection to include all states and possibly cities.
- Generate route maps in real-time.

## 📊 Data Sources

- National Parks: Park coordinates and data were obtained from the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov) API ([Documentation](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm)).
- Google Maps: Travel distances and durations were obtained from [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) API ([Documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation)).
- US States: Coordinates were obtained from public [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tennerimaheshwar/us-state-and-territory-latitude-and-longitude-data).
